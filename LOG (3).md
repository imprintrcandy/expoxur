## Mission Update: Role Assignment Bug Discovered in Signup Flow 🐞

### 🐞 Bug Identified:
- Users signing up as Organizers were redirected to Attendee dashboards
- `role` not passed correctly via `user_metadata`
- Supabase fallback defaulted all roles to `attendee`

---

## 📬 Orders Sent to Lovable:
- Fix front-end: ensure selected `role` is passed via metadata
- Verify Supabase `handle_new_user()` function extracts `role` properly
- Re-test and confirm routing to correct dashboards

---

## 🧠 Captain’s Notes:
This fix is critical — identity = destiny on this platform.
Once corrected, we’ll validate the integrity of the onboarding flow for all user types.

## Mission: Organizer Event Creation Workflow Finalized 🧭

### ✅ New Feature Flow Documented:
After an organizer fills out and submits the "Create Event" form, the following behavior is now defined and requested:

---

### 📍 System Behavior:
1. **Event Record Creation**
   - Inserts data into `events` table with fields:
     - `event_name`, `description`, `category`, `location`
     - `start_date`, `end_date`, `status`, `organizer_id`, `created_at`

2. **Post-Submit Redirect + Confirmation**
   - Redirect organizer to “My Events” tab **or**
   - Show success screen with CTAs:
     - ✅ View Event on Public Page
     - ➕ Tag Exhibitors
     - 📣 Promote This Event
   - Display toast: “🎉 Event Created Successfully!”

3. **Public Events Page Sync**
   - Event appears on `/events` or `/upcoming-events`
   - Linked to organizer’s public profile

---

### 💡 Optional Enhancements:
- Upload event banner/logo
- Pin featured events on public profile
- Add “Create Another Event” quick button

---

## 🧠 Captain’s Notes:
This officially completes the core of our Organizer Ops loop — from dashboard to public launch. Once implemented, we’ll test it with real campaigns like the *Motherpiquer Podcast Launch Event*.

We are now ready to connect exhibitors and unlock full ecosystem flow.
