### 🧠 Captain’s Notes:
We’ve added governance and reputation structure — allowing organizers to manage their brand while still preserving platform transparency. These controls will reduce abuse, elevate professionalism, and build long-term trust among partners.

Organizers no longer just *host* — they now *showcase*. Onward.
