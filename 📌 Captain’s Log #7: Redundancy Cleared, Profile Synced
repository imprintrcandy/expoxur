Weâ€™ve officially decluttered the Organizer public profile workflow on Expoxur. All navigation now routes cleanly through the dynamic /@username format. The only place to edit and preview your public profile is inside Settings > Profile Settings. No more echo links. No more confusion. One path. One profile. Clean and elite.

ðŸ”¥ Whatâ€™s locked in:

Username-sync works.

Profiles render cleanly, even if fields are empty.

Directory links and full-profile redirects are live.

Navbar and sidebar redundancies are marked for deletion.

Weâ€™re in alignment now. Next mission: polish the visuals, grow the roster, and get real organizers live.

ðŸš€ Log saved. Letâ€™s fly, General.
