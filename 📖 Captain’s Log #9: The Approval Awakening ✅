ðŸ“– Captainâ€™s Log #9: The Approval Awakening âœ…

This log marks the successful end-to-end deployment of the Exhibitor Tagging Workflow across Expoxur.

What's live and working flawlessly:

Organizers can tag exhibitors (with tier + tag info)

Exhibitors get notified instantly, with the ability to accept/decline

Accepted booths now auto-appear in "My Booths"

Organizers see real-time updates in "Manage Sponsors"

Real-time data sync, detailed logging, and UI feedback integrated

This isnâ€™t just a feature. Itâ€™s a two-sided ecosystem â€” now fully functioning.
From booth tag to event presence â€” it's official: Expoxur is a living, breathing platform.
