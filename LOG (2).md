## Mission Update: Role Assignment Bug Discovered in Signup Flow 🐞

### 🐞 Bug Identified:
- Users signing up as Organizers were redirected to Attendee dashboards
- `role` not passed correctly via `user_metadata`
- Supabase fallback defaulted all roles to `attendee`

---

## 📬 Orders Sent to Lovable:
- Fix front-end: ensure selected `role` is passed via metadata
- Verify Supabase `handle_new_user()` function extracts `role` properly
- Re-test and confirm routing to correct dashboards

---

## 🧠 Captain’s Notes:
This fix is critical — identity = destiny on this platform.
Once corrected, we’ll validate the integrity of the onboarding flow for all user types.
